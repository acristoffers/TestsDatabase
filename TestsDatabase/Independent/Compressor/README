This is the executable that compresses blob.txt into blob
It actually compresses to stdout so you need to call it like

./compressor blob.txt > blob

It needs to be compiled manually as I won't provide any makefile for it, but it's rather simple.
Compile BZLib without linking

gcc -c *.c

them compile the cpp without linking

g++ -c main.cpp

them link it all together

g++ *.o -o compressor

That should do, if not, compile BZLib as a static library and link main.cpp against it
