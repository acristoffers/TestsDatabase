Test Database
=============
Create a database with questions and easely print tests.

Categories
----------
You can organize your questions into categories.
A category can have subcategories, so you can make a tree as deep as needed.

Questions
---------
Your questions can have a internal title, a reference (so you know where it came from), a difficulty level (0 to 10), a beatiful body (WYSIWYG editor) and as much anserwers as you want.
For now (and probably forever) the only supported question format is multi-choice.

MIT Licenced!
-------------
You can fork it and modify as you wish!
